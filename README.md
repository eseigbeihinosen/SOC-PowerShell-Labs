# SOC-PowerShell-Labs

This repository contains PowerShell scripts for SOC labs.  

## Current Scripts

- **Windows Event Log Monitoring**  
  Collects Windows Security events (login success, login failure, admin privilege events) and exports them to CSV in the Logs folder.

## Notes

- The **Logs folder** is ignored in Git (`.gitignore`) for privacy.
- More SOC monitoring scripts will be added later.
